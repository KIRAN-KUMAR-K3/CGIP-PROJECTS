# CGIP-PROJECTS

Welcome to the **CGIP-PROJECTS** repository! This project features a collection of Python scripts focusing on Computer Graphics and Image Processing (CGIP). These scripts demonstrate various techniques and algorithms in the field, ranging from basic 2D rendering to advanced image processing.

## Contents

1. **1_Brees.py** - Implementation of Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm.
2. **2_2d_object.py** - Basic creation and rendering of 2D objects.
3. **3_3dobject.py** - 3D object modeling and visualization techniques.
4. **4_2d_transformation.py** - Implementation of 2D transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.
5. **5_3d_transformation.py** - 3D transformations including rotation and scaling.
6. **6_animation_effect.py** - Simple animation effects using 2D and 3D objects.
7. **7_4quadrants.py** - Visualization of objects in all four quadrants.
8. **8_rotation.py** - Algorithms for rotating objects in both 2D and 3D spaces.
9. **9_low_level.py** - Exploration of low-level graphics programming techniques.
10. **10_smoothing.py** - Techniques for image smoothing and filtering.
11. **11_contour.py** - Detection of contours in images.
12. **12_face_detection.py** - Basic face detection using OpenCV.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Pillow (Python Imaging Library)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KIRAN-KUMAR-K3/CGIP-PROJECTS.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd CGIP-PROJECTS
    ```
3. **Run the Desired Python Script**:
    ```bash
    python <script_name.py>
    ```

Replace `<script_name.py>` with the name of the script you want to execute.
